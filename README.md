# Glance

[Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) is a self-hosted dashboard that puts all your feeds in one place.
This plugin downloads official Glance releases from GitHub and hosts them from within Scrypted. To access your
instance, go to the [Scrypted landing page](/endpoint/@scrypted/core/public/) and select the Glance launcher
item.

For a full list of configuration options, consult the official Glance [documentation](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).
